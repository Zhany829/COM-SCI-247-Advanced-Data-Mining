You will encounter two types of problems: *write-up problems* and *coding problems*.\n","\n","1. **Write-up Problems:** These problems are primarily theoretical, requiring you to demonstrate your understanding of lecture concepts and to provide mathematical proofs for key theorems. Your answers should include sufficient steps for the mathematical derivations.\n","2. **Coding Problems:** Here, you will be engaging with practical coding tasks. These may involve completing code segments provided in the notebooks or developing models from scratch.\n","\n","To ensure clarity and consistency in your submissions, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n","\n","* For write-up problems, use Markdown bullet points to format text answers. Also, express all mathematical equations using $\\LaTeX$ and avoid plain text such as `x0`, `x^1`, or `R x Q` for equations.\n","* For coding problems, comment on your code thoroughly for readability and ensure your code is executable. Non-runnable code may lead to a loss of **all** points. Coding problems have automated grading, and altering the grading code will result in a deduction of **all** points.\n","* Your submission should show the entire process of data loading, preprocessing, model implementation, training, and result analysis. This can be achieved through a mix of explanatory text cells, inline comments, intermediate result displays, and experimental visualizations.\n","\n","### Submission Requirements\n","\n","* Submit your solutions through GradeScope in BruinLearn.\n","* Late submissions are allowed up to 24 hours post-deadline with a penalty factor of $\\mathbf{1}(t\\leq24)e^{-(\\ln(2)/12)t}$.\n","\n","### Collaboration and Integrity\n","\n","* Collaboration is encouraged, but all final submissions must be your own work. Please acknowledge any collaboration or external sources used, including websites, papers, and GitHub repositories.\n","* Any suspicious cases of academic misconduct will be reported to The Office of the Dean of Students.\n","\n","## Outline\n","* Part 1: Topic Model Continued\n","* Part 2: Word Embeddings"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Gl5ITLUf1NRn"},"source":["#### GPU Support\n","\n","Considering the size of the training data, it is strongly suggested to use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or a GPU server for this exercise.

The function should take a batch of context-target pairs as input and return the loss. You will need to compute the objective function using the negative log-likelihood loss. Then, you will need to update the model parameters using the optimizer.\n","Note that in PyTorch, [`CrossEntropyLoss` combines `LogSoftmax` and `NLLLoss` in a single class](https://towardsdatascience.com/cross-entropy-negative-log-likelihood-and-all-that-jazz-47a95bd2e81). Therefore, you can directly use `CrossEntropyLoss` to compute the negative log-likelihood loss.\n","\n","Here we use the [Adam optimizer](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.Adam) with a learning rate of 0.01. During last week's discussions, we mentioned the importance of choosing appropriate optimizers and learning rates. In practice, the Adam optimizer is a good choice for many tasks, while SGD can lead to better convergence in some cases. However, the choice of learning rate can be more tricky. In general, a learning rate that is too small will lead to slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large will lead to divergence. In this exercise, you can use the default learning rate of 0.01. However, you are encouraged to experiment with different optimizers and/or learning rates and observe the impact on the training process.\n","\n","For every 5 epochs, you will need to evaluate the model by finding the top-5 most similar words to \"Basketball\". You should observe that as the training progresses, the model is able to find more relevant words for \"Basketball\".
